sql doe not automatically update tables, you have to use alembic
database.py is a python file and whatever your table was named as .db is your database file
responses must correlate with the schema 
your objects that should be created must exist in all versions of models(schema, response, create_user)
"type annotations" is used in schema inside a class, never assignment
config is important to read sql data directly
bind egine using Base.metadata.create_all to save yourself future stress.
